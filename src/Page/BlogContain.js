        <p>1. Artificial intelligence
In the past, whenever people talked about the future of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) was always high on the agenda. But finally I think it’s actually justified. Unless you’ve had your head in the ground, a lot of advances have been made in the field of AI and web development in the last year.

2023 was the year that belonged to ChatGPT. There’s a reason why Cambridge Dictionary’s Word of the Year was “hallucinate,” and it had nothing to do with psychedelics.

Finally, many of the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft, and Meta (formerly Facebook), have been releasing their generative AI technology to be used by the public.

With easier access to the necessary tools for AI development, we can expect developers to start using AI in new and different ways in the new year. What’s more AI already features heavily in data analytics, so expect the rest to follow suit. For example, GitHub’s Copilot is just one of a multitude of AI programming tools which are becoming a casual part of developer’s workflows.

In fact, another sign of AI as a trend is the success of The Grid itself—it’s currently sunsetting V2 and preparing to launch a new one sometime in 2023.

2. Low-code and no-code tools
To be honest, I initially had a dilemma about whether to include this as one of the trends. Surely the success of low-code and no-code tools will be encouraging fewer people to learn to code, right?

Not exactly.

While the continued rise of these tools is in part an answer to the same coding skills gap that made web development a lucrative career salary-wise, the computers are not coming to take your jobs. In fact, we would actually still need to train the developers to operate the LC:NC tools anyway.

These tools will help smaller companies get development (and no-code design work) work done faster, definitely in tandem with generative AI tools. The low-code market is projected to hit 148.5 billion dollars by 2030, so watch this space.<br/><br/>

3. Internet of Things (IoT)
Long heralded as the future, in the past while some might have felt that the internet of things is already finished. However, this movement where typically non-internet-connected objects are given network connectivity in order to send and receive data is only getting started.

Web developers may not have been directly involved in the creation of such devices (that’s for product designers), with UI designers working more heavily through voice user interfaces. Coders are involved in the development of applications that use, analyse and display the devices’ data. Companies such as Xively and BugLabs have already started working on APIs that can be used by developers to communicate with IoT devices.

Moving into 2024, developers are exploring ways to integrate IoT data into web platforms, enabling real-time data visualizations, predictive analytics, and personalized experiences. <br/><br/>

4. AI chatbots
While again, these may have been around in one guise or another in recent years, expect this area of work to become a huge growth area in 2024, after the success of generative AI and LLMs last year.

Essentially, the reason for this is that the accuracy and usability of these chatbots has seriously increased and become more sophisticated, giving companies far more opportunities to employ them.

In terms of the technology behind them, opportunities for backend developers are plenty, as they require complex information retrieval, language processing, and machine learning systems to flourish. Machine learning and AI engineers are also popular AI jobs to explore for this. Web developers fluent in machine learning languages such as Java, R, and Python will find themselves with a whole host of opportunities and interesting projects to get to grips with.

In terms of whether this trend will be a longer-lasting one, it’s easy to see that this is one of them. Not only do companies save money on employing customer support staff, they also mean they can reach even more of their customers than before, with companies employing chatbots on their social media platforms as well.<br/><br/>

5. Angular 17 and beyond
Way back in 2016 a different version of Angular came out, and with it came a lot of changes —Google’s frontend JavaScript framework was been completely redesigned.

It now takes advantage of JavaScript ES6’s features, applications are written in TypeScript, and they now moved towards a more component-driven architecture.

Along with backwards compatibility, Angular now has a more defined and regular release schedule. It’s planned that Angular 18.0 will be released in May 2024.</p>
